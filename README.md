## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- Open Weathermaps API

## Description
Ostensibly this app should allow a user to input the name of a city in order to find the current weather conditions and 5 day forecast for that city.  Furthermore, this app should also allow users to save past searches to Local Storage and display those past searches as buttons.  For whatever reason, the browser can't convert the city name into the requisite latitude and longitude coordinates and so the function returns an error.
